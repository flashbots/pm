FLASHBOTS provides free-to-use software to Ethereum Network node operators, miners, transactors, and other participants (“**MEV Geth**”) and operates a service, the “**Relay**”, which connects persons seeking to transact on the Ethereum Network to block producers on the same, along with certain other related services and online websites (collectively, such services the “**Flashbots Services**”).

FLASHBOTS shall have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Flashbots Service, including, but not limited to, content, access, or use.

### ELIGIBILITY

You represent and warrant that You are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in Your state or jurisdiction of residence, whichever is greater, that You are capable of entering into a legally binding agreement and that You reside in a jurisdiction where Your use of the Flashbots Service is lawful. Your right to use the Flashbots Services is conditioned upon Your acceptance and compliance with these ToS. If You do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in these ToS, You are not authorized to use the Flashbots Service and You agree to immediately discontinue any access to or use of the Flashbots Service.

In addition, in order to participate in the Relay, you may need to download, install, and run MEV Geth and, in certain situations discussed at greater length below, undertake certain personal and account verification steps prior to using the Relay.

### AVAILABILITY

FLASHBOTS does not represent that the Relay or any other aspect of the Flashbots Services will be available without interruption or for any particular duration, and shall not be responsible for any losses, damages, costs, expenses, lost opportunities, or other harm suffered by You in connection with interruption or termination of the Flashbots Services. YOU SHOULD READ THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN, WHICH INCLUDES LIMITATIONS ON FLASHBOTS POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR ANY SUCH SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS.

### ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RISK

You acknowledge that the underlying blockchain technologies involved in using the Flashbots Service are novel, technically complex, and involve inherent risks, with or without the use of GETH or the Flashbots Service. You bear all risk of loss from Your use of the Flashbots Service. FLASHBOTS shall have no liability for fluctuations in the value of any cryptocurrency, transaction, or any bundle of transactions, whether requested or provided.

You acknowledge that FLASHBOTS is constantly improving its security measures against security breaches that might result in the loss of data. In such a case, FLASHBOTS and its third-party partners responsible for the operation of the Flashbots Service or software shall not be liable to users for any damage caused.

You acknowledge that the Flashbots Services involve novel technological innovations aimed at facilitating more efficient access to blockchains.  Results depend on a multiplicity of factors beyond the control of FLASHBOTS, including but not limited to luck, network difficulty, latency, reject rate, fees/tips, the activities of searchers and block producers, etc. Therefore, the outcomes cannot be predicted, and no representations or warranties are made with respect to the Flashbots Services.  OUTCOMES ARE NOT GUARANTEED.

Your participation in the Flashbots Service involves the use of sophisticated hardware and software. FLASHBOTS will not be liable or responsible to You, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms of Service, for any failure or delay in our performance under these Terms of Service when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control and/or from the hardware used in the Flashbots Service, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, pandemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown, or power outage.

By accepting these Terms and using the Flashbots Service, You represent that you have the technical and financial knowledge, experience, and wherewithal to understand and undertake these risks.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FLASHBOTS IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS, AND THAT YOU ALONE ARE ASSUMING THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. IN NO EVENT WILL FLASHBOTS, ITS AFFILIATES, ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, MEMBERS, OWNERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR PROVIDING THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE OR THE SOFTWARE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE.

FLASHBOTS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS TO THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” FLASHBOTS DOES NOT WARRANT, AND AFFIRMATIVELY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING, THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION, TEXT, GRAPHICS, LINKS OR OTHER ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE OR ON THE FLASHBOTS WEBSITE. FLASHBOTS PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA. FLASHBOTS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, OR THE MISUSE OR MISINTERPRETATION OF, ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE OR THE OPERATION THEREOF. FLASHBOTS MAY CHANGE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE AT ANY TIME AND MAKES NO COMMITMENT TO UPDATE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE OF THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH OR FROM THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL FLASHBOTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF YOU OR THE RELEVANT PARTY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM LOSS FROM YOUR: (I) INABILITY TO USE, (II) USE, AND/OR (III) MISUSE OF, DATA; NOR SHALL FLASHBOTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE, DOCUMENTS, PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE RELATED TO THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

IN NO EVENT WILL FLASHBOTS OR ITS AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY TORT, CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE, OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY FLASHBOTS. FLASHBOTS AND AGENTS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU AND/OR ANY THIRD PARTY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF FLASHBOTS AND/OR ITS AGENTS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE; (II) THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MISDELIVERY, OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY USER DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS; (III) THE COST OF GETTING SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE; (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (V) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANYONE ON THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE; (VI) THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THE THIRD PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED PREVIOUSLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; OR (VII) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT IN ANY WAY HOLD FLASHBOTS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SELECTION OR RETENTION OF, OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF, THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FLASHBOTS SERVICE.

Because some states and jurisdictions prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to You, and the respective liability of FLASHBOTS and its agents, employees, distributors and agents is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states.

In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liabilities or remedies available as set forth in this Agreement, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of Your remedies under these Terms of Service fail, then You expressly agree that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of FLASHBOTS and its agents, employees, distributors, agents or affiliates, to You or any party claiming by or through You for any cause whatsoever, exceed $100 (U.S.), regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.

LINKS FOUND IN THE FLASHBOTS SERVICES MAY LET YOU LEAVE THE FLASHBOTS SERVICES TO ENTER OTHER SITES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH LINKED SITES ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF FLASHBOTS, AND FLASHBOTS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENTS OF ANY LINKED SITE OR ANY LINK CONTAINED IN A LINKED SITE, OR ANY CHANGES OR UPDATES TO SUCH SITES. FLASHBOTS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WEBCASTING OR ANY OTHER FORM OF TRANSMISSION RECEIVED FROM ANY LINKED SITE. FLASHBOTS IS PROVIDING THESE LINKS TO YOU ONLY AS A CONVENIENCE, AND THE INCLUSION OF ANY LINK DOES NOT IMPLY ENDORSEMENT OF THE SITE BY FLASHBOTS. ONCE YOU TRANSFER TO ANOTHER SITE, YOU ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR TERMS OF USE, PRIVACY POLICY AND COOKIE POLICY, IF ANY.

### INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless FLASHBOTS, its affiliates and their respective owners, members, directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all Federal, State, and International, claims, demands, losses, costs, and/or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of the use of the Flashbots Service by You.

### CHOICE OF LAW

These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, excluding that body of laws pertaining to conflict of laws. If any provision of these Terms of Service is determined by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain effective and enforceable.

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, these Terms of Service and any access to or use of the Flashbots Service will be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof. All disputes of any nature related to these Terms of Service shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in the Cayman Islands before a single arbitrator. The parties shall agree on the rules and procedures to be followed in the arbitration. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and the arbitrator shall apply the laws applicable in the Cayman Islands (without regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof). Judgment on the arbitral award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The foregoing arbitration provisions shall not preclude either party from seeking an injunction or other provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall, in the arbitral award, allocate all or part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator and reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party, for payment by the non-prevailing party, and shall determine the prevailing party for this purpose. The parties further agree that (i) any claims brought by either party must be brought in such party’s individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and (ii) the arbitrator may not (x) consolidate more than one person’s claims, (y) otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding or (z) award class-wide relief.  BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
