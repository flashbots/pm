# Systems Engineer

## Description

Flashbots is looking for a backend engineer with experience scaling distributed systems and performing low-level optimizations. Experience with ethereum clients and secure enclaves like SGX preferred. Responsible for working with privacy researchers and owning the implementation of production ready privacy solution for Flashbots. Should be comfortable working with C++ and/or Rust.

## Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. We are not your typical startup, we are fully remote and our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8).

If you are a self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with asymmetic impact, you will fit right in.
