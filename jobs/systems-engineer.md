## Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. We are not your typical startup, our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8).

If you are a self-reliant, self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with asymmetic impact and opportunities, you will fit right in.
