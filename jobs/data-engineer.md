# Data Engineer

## Description

Flashbots is looking for a data engineer with experience architecting, optimizing, and maintaining data infrastructure. You will own and be responsible for all Flashbots data pipelines aggregating data across our services and servicing research and product teams with data needs. You must have some existing understanding of DeFi protocols and ability to create / improve [mev-inspect codebase](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs).

## Flashbots

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. We are not your typical startup, our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8).

If you are a self-reliant, self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with asymmetic impact and opportunities, you will fit right in.
